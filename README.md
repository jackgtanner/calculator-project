This is my version of the Calculator project, which is part of the Odin Project's learning course
The user is presented with a simple functioning calculator when the page loads
They're able to then perform basic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication
Languages I used within this project were: HTML, CSS, Javascript. While the main concept to practice was DOM manipulation within JS by changing the display dynamically, as well as to practice the use of functions within JS for when the user wants to add, subtract ect...
